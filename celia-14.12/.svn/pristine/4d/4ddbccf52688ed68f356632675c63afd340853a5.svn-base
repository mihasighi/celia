About
=====
This is a distribution package for the CINV libraries and the plugin Celia.


Required
========
APRON platform:
	- improved version available as Ubuntu 10 package  in the Ocaml distribution
	- original version available at [http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/] which requires:
OCaml	(package ocaml)
Camlidl (package ocaml-camlidl-devel)
C  libraries: 
  GMP (http://gmplib.org)
  MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/)
PPL (optionally)

FIXPOINT engine [http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/people/bjeannet/bjeannet-forge/interproc/index.html]

FRAMA-C platform version Boron-20100401:
	- available as Ubunto 10 package
	- source distribution available at [http://www.frama-c.com/]

To facilitate the installation of CINV, we provide the Apron and Fixpoint distributions.

To configure
============
[in the distribution directory]

Generate configure script by executing in the cinv directory

	> autoconf

Configure the Makefile with the local settings by executing

	> ./configure

Set the environement variable CINV to the distribution directory:

> export CINV=`pwd`


To compile and install
========================
[To compile a debug version set $DEBUG to _debug.]

All the commands below are included in the install.sh file, so:

> ./install.sh

It contains the following commands:

* to install FIXPOINT

> make -C interproc-dist all
> make -C interproc-dist install

* to install Apron

> make -C apron-dist all
> make -C apron-dist install

* to compile SMTLIB parser

> make -C smtlib2parser-dist all

* to compile CINV abstract domains

> make -C shapes all
> make -C shapes ml

* to compile SL3 decision procedure

> make -C shapes sl3dp

* to compile CINV engine

> make -C src clim.cma

* to compile CELIA plug-in

> make -C frama-c-plugin frama-c-Celia.byte

The plug-in is avaliable in the frama-c-plugin directory.

Testing Celia plugin
====================
Step 1) The libraries for the abstract domains provided by CINV are loaded dynamically,
        so you have to set the path to the directory where they are installed, e.g.:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CINV/shapes:$CINV/smtlib2parser-dist:$CINV/apron-dist/mlgmpidl/lib:$CINV/apron-dist/apron/lib

Step 2) In the directory $CINV/samples each example XXX.c comes with 
	- a makefile XXX.makefile and a list of configuration files:
	- XXX-yyyy.prop where yyyy fixes the domain of data words used in the analysis
	  (mset, lsum, ucons)
	- XXX-funs.prop where parameters for the analysis of each function are fixed
	- XXX-cinv-ucons.txt where parameters for yyyy=ucons are fixed

	PLease write the corresponding files and lines in the makefile if you want to add
	other analyses.

Step 3) Call Frama-c with plugin Celia using the XXX.makefile

	> make -f XXX.makefile <analysis>

	where <analysis> is one of (mset, lsum, ucons)

        Do not forget to include all the source files to analyze your code. 
        The basic declarations for linked lists can be found in cinv/samples/c/linked_list.h
        and the sources are in cinv/samples/c/linked_list*.c


Testing SL3 decision procedure
==============================

1) The binary is sl3dp, generated in shapes and installed in bin.
   The environment variables mentioned above shall also be set.

2) In the directory samples/smtlib examples of entailment problems in SL3
   are given as files 
	sl3_*.smt
	auflia_*.smt

3) Execute the decision procedure by

	> sl3dp file.smt
