About
=====
This is a distribution package for the Celia tool.


Required
========
apron                   version 0.9.10 (tested release 12.fc20)
ocaml                   version 4.00.1 (tested release 3.fc20)
ocaml-camlidl-devel     version 1.05   (tested release 19.fc20.1)
gmp                     version 5.1.2  (tested release 2.fc20)
mpfr                    version 3.1.2  (tested release 5.fc20)
frama-c                 version Neon-20140301

To facilitate the installation of CELIA, we provide the Fixpoint distribution
[http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/people/bjeannet/bjeannet-forge/interproc/index.html]

To configure
============
[in the distribution directory]

Generate configure script by executing in the cinv directory

	> autoconf

Configure the Makefile with the local settings by executing

	> ./configure

Set the environment variable CINV to the distribution directory:

> export CINV=`pwd`

Set also variables for the apron, ocaml, gmp, mpfr, ppl libraries 
in Makefile.config


To compile and install
========================
[To compile a debug version set $DEBUG to _debug.]

All the commands below are included in the install.sh file, so:

> ./install.sh

It contains the following commands:

* to install FIXPOINT

> make -C interproc-dist all
> make -C interproc-dist install

* to compile SMTLIB parser

> make -C smtlib2parser-dist all

* to compile CINV abstract domains

> make -C shapes all
> make -C shapes ml

* to compile SL3 decision procedure

> make -C shapes sl3dp

* to compile CINV engine

> make -C src clim.cma

* to compile CELIA plug-in

> make -C frama-c-plugin frama-c-Celia.byte

The plug-in is avaliable in the frama-c-plugin directory.

Testing Celia plugin
====================
Step 1) The libraries for the abstract domains provided by CINV are loaded dynamically,
        so you have to set the path to the directory where they are installed, e.g.:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CINV/shapes:$CINV/smtlib2parser-dist:$CINV/apron-dist/mlgmpidl/lib:$CINV/apron-dist/apron/lib

Step 2) In the directory $CINV/samples each example XXX.c comes with 
	- a makefile XXX.makefile and a list of configuration files:
	- XXX-yyyy.prop where yyyy fixes the domain of data words used in the analysis
	  (mset, lsum, ucons)
	- XXX-funs.prop where parameters for the analysis of each function are fixed
	- XXX-cinv-ucons.txt where parameters for yyyy=ucons are fixed

	PLease write the corresponding files and lines in the makefile if you want to add
	other analyses.

Step 3) Call Frama-c with plugin Celia using the XXX.makefile

	> make -f XXX.makefile <analysis>

	where <analysis> is one of (mset, lsum, ucons)

        Do not forget to include all the source files to analyze your code. 
        The basic declarations for linked lists can be found in cinv/samples/c/linked_list.h
        and the sources are in cinv/samples/c/linked_list*.c


Testing SL3 decision procedure
==============================

1) The binary is sl3dp, generated in shapes and installed in bin.
   The environment variables mentioned above shall also be set.

2) In the directory samples/smtlib examples of entailment problems in SL3
   are given as files 
	sl3_*.smt
	auflia_*.smt

3) Execute the decision procedure by

	> sl3dp file.smt
