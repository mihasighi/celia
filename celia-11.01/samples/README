HOW TO PRODUCE EXAMPLES
=======================

1. C Examples
-------------
A. The directories including examples in C are c and cspl.

B. To analyse one example call

	$CINV [options] -c c/file.c

C. To do a batch run on all c examples call

	./try.sh -c 


2. SPL Examples
---------------
A. Directories spl and splold contains spl programs
  with new resp. old encoding of pointer programs in spl.
  Only the new encoding is accepted now by CINV.

B. To obtain a new encoding file from an old encoding file call

	./spl_io -2new file.spl

C. To decode the new encoding to a more lisible format call

	./spl_io -2ptr file.spl

D. To encode in C an old encoding file call

	./spl_io -2c file.spl

E. To translate in new encoding a lisible format generated and 2.C) call

	./spl_io -2new file.ptr

F. To apply the analysis to an SPL file (new encoding) call

	$CINV [options] -spl spl/file.spl

C. To do a batch run on all c examples call

	./try.sh -spl
