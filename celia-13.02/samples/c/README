HOW TO PRODUCE EXAMPLES
=======================

A. The directory including the intlist library and other C examples.

All examples compile for

        CPP=$CPP" -I $FRAMAC/libc"



B. Before lauching CELIA, please ensure that you have set:

B.1. the CINV and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as 
     shown in the file $CINV/install.sh

B.2. the parameters of the analysis are set in .prop files. Examples
     of .prop files are given in this directory for each data word domain
     (lsum, mset, ucons) and for functions analyzed in these files (files
     *-funs.prop).

B.3. the C files use the intlist.h file.

B.4. examples of calling the analysis are given in *.makefile files.

C. Call CELIA by executing

	make -f <ex>.makefile  <dwdomain>

   e.g.,
	make -f intlist-fold-reverse.makefile ucons

D. The results are provided in the directory

	<ex-dwdomain>

   which is the renaming of the `pan' directory produced
   during the analysis.
