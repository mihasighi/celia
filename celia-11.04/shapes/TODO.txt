Coding of universal formulas:

1) done by calling domain_meet_lincons with a lcons having
   lcons->scalar == OFFSET_UCONS

2) This is the only case in which this function is called.
   The semantics is:

        a meet universal formula created using the constraint

   But in general, a does not contains a formula for the node
   and for the pattern. So a simple assignement (and strengthening?)
   shall be enough.

3) lcons has the form:
     n1 + n2 + ... + nk + code = OFFSET_UCONS
   where
	ni 	are the nodes to be constrainted by the formula,
        code	is the code used to represent the formula


4) The list of lcons and their codes are:

	n + 1 = 0	means	forall y. 1<= y < len(n) ==> d(y)=y
